title: "Spatial Data"
---

This section is about data measured across a 2D spatial location where the
dependency between measurements decreases as the distance between measurements
increases.

First simulate some data which could have come from an array of sensors.

```tut:silent
import com.github.jonnylaw.gp._

val locations = ???_
```
